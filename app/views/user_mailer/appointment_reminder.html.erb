<p>
	Hi <%= @to.name %>,	
</p>

<p>
	We just wanted to remind you that you have an upcoming <%= link_to "Appointment", expert_appointment_url(@appointment.expert.id, @appointment.id) %> with <%= @appointment_with.name %> at <%= @appointment.time.to_formatted_s(:long)%>.	
</p>

<p>
	At this point <%= @appointment_with.name %> has specially reserved this time just for you, so you cannot update or change the appointment.	
</p>

<p>
	We look forward to hearing about how your appointment went! If you ever have any questions or thoughts, don't hesitate to contact me at support@lorious.com.	
</p>

<p>
Sincerely,<br />
Henry<br />
co-founder of Lorious<br />
